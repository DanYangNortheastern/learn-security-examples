- Briefly explain the vulnerability and why the secure version prevents the vulnerability.
- What additional security mechanisms can you incorporate to prevent such attacks?


A DoS attack overwhelms a system, network, or website, making it unavailable to intended users. 
This kind of attack exploits the availability aspect of the CIA triad, as it prevents legitimate users from 
accessing services or information. To counteract DoS attacks, a secure version of a system might include better 
traffic filtering, rate limiting, and robust authentication mechanisms to distinguish and block malicious traffic.
