Briefly explain the vulnerability and why the secure version prevents the vulnerability.
Which CIA property does tampering violate?
What additional security mechanisms can you incorporate?

Information disclosure is when confidential data gets exposed to unauthorized individuals, 
like someone seeing your private messages. This vulnerability breaches the confidentiality 
aspect of the CIA triad, as it's all about keeping data private and accessible only to those 
who are supposed to see it. Implementing secure versions, like encryption and strict access controls, 
prevents unauthorized access to this sensitive info.
