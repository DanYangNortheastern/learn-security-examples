Tampering is when someone unauthorized alters information, like changing your grades or messing with data. 
This kind of attack directly hits the integrity part of the CIA triad because it's all about ensuring data 
remains correct and unaltered. To stop tampering, we use things like access controls, encryption, and checksums, 
ensuring only the right people touch our data and that any changes are legit and traceable.
