Briefly explain the vulnerability and why the secure version prevents the vulnerability.

Spoofing is when a hacker pretends to be someone else in a network to steal data or cause harm, 
mainly messing with the integrity and authenticity of information. It's like if someone faked your 
ID to take your exam; they break trust and potentially change outcomes. To prevent this, we use stuff 
like two-factor authentication, encryption, and firewall settings, making sure the person or device is legit. 
This way, we keep data real and secure, stopping hackers from playing dress-up with our information.

Spoofing primarily violates integrity as it because spoofing can alter or manipulate data.
