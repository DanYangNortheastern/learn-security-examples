- Briefly explain the vulnerability and why the secure version is better at preventing repudiation than the insecure version.
- What additional security mechanisms can you incorporate to prevent such attacks?

Repudiation refers to the ability of users (or attackers) to deny their actions on a system. In a security context, 
it's a vulnerability where an individual can perform an action on a system but there's no way to prove they did it, 
making accountability and tracking challenging. This can be particularly problematic in cases of unauthorized access 
or malicious activities, as it hampers the ability to trace actions back to the perpetrator.
