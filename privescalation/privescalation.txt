Privilege escalation is when an attacker gains elevated access to resources that are normally protected 
from an application or user. The vulnerability occurs when an application or system does not properly 
enforce access controls, allowing an attacker to elevate their privileges within the system, often leading 
to unauthorized access to sensitive information or control over system functions.
